# Sehat

## Inspiration

In the wake of depression and other mental health-related issues, many families lost their loved ones in which one of my family was of my close friend.

Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.

Also according to WHO, nearly 65 percent of Indonesian men smoke daily which leads to serious health complications too. Regular smokers are prone to the risk of cancers of the mouth, larynx, esophagus,
 throat, and pancreatic cancer. Moreover, excess intake of alcohol leads to severe health complications like kidney and liver dysfunction.

Therefore, we decided to develop a web app named SEHAT to deal with health issues
like depression, anxiety, smoking, drinking, etc.

## What it does

SEHAT covers many different problems, we have a different approach for each issue :
👉🏻 Users can provide details of their close ones so that they can track users' moods on a daily basis which will eventually help them to monitor users' health closely. 

👉🏻 Users will be provided with some health/symptom assessments which will generate a symptom profile that can help the user understand their health issues in a better way.

👉🏻 Professional psychiatrists can register themselves so that users can book an appointment for assistance.

👉🏻 A plan will be prepared for the user to follow by analyzing the user's symptom profile.

👉🏻 Users will be able to track and keep a record of their moods on daily basis by using our mood tracker.

👉🏻 Our chatbot named Eva is built with the function to interact with the user by listening to their problems and giving them suggestions.

## How we built it

🚀 We designed our website using **HTML5, CSS3, SASS, Javascript/jQuery, Bootstrap**.

🚀 We were able to implement the scrolling effect by using the **Gsap library**.

🚀 We also used Google Cloud to create a **chatbot** using Dialogflow.

🚀 We have used **Twillio API** to send emails and linked with the frontend using the **NodeJS server**.

🚀 We implemented our features using Javascript/jQuery and also used **Moment.js** for managing dates. 

## Challenges we ran into

There were many different challenges that we ran into while developing our website:

❌ Using Twilio API and Google Dialogflow was a totally new experience for us. However, we were flexible enough to get the function works on our website.

❌ It was hard to find relatable illustrations and resources.

❌ Time management, as there was a lot of research involved in this project.

❌ Generating a pie chart by analyzing the data was a tricky one.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud that we have made a website that can reduce Mental and physical issues of people and helps them come out of it positively and helps reduce suicidal rates as it's a serious rising issue.
We are happy that our website will make an impact on young minds and help them think deeply about their life and take the right decision and even face difficult 
situations boldly.

## What we learned

We expanded our knowledge in Twilio API, Google Dialogflow, Gsap, and Moment.js. In implementing our features we ran into many errors which we had to solve.  
Finally, we used the sponsor's services well.

## What's next for SEHAT

⭐️ We are thinking of using data analytics to make our website more robust.

⭐️ We are thinking to implement a music suggestion system that will suggest music according to the user's mood.

⭐️ We are further thinking to add a lung cancer prediction system in accordance with the smoking assessment.

⭐️ Further, we are thinking to make it more responsive.
